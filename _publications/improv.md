title: "improv: A flexible software platform for adaptive neuroscience experiments"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/improv
excerpt: 'We introduce improv, a software platform that allows users to flexibly specify and manage adaptive experiments to integrate data collection, preprocessing, visualization, and user-defined analytics. Using improv for streaming data analysis for two-photon calcium imaging and behavior, we demonstrate how access to online information can be used for automated, integrated experimentation.'

We introduce improv, a software platform that allows users to flexibly specify and manage adaptive experiments to integrate data collection, preprocessing, visualization, and user-defined analytics. Using improv for streaming data analysis for two photon calcium imaging and behavior we demonstrate how access to online information can be used for automated, integrated experimentation.
