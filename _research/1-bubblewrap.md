title: "Bubblewrap: Online tiling and real-time flow prediction on neural manifolds"
excerpt: "<br><img src='/images/bubblewrap.png' width='80%'>
<br/><br/>We developed a new method for approximating dynamics as a probability flow between discrete tiles on a low-dimensional manifold. The model can be trained quickly and retains predictive performance many time steps into the future, and is fast enough to serve as a component of closed-loop causal experiments in neuroscience. Our recent preprint on this work can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13941).

How can we get connectivity between large systems of neurons in vivo? Using stimulations of small ensembles and a statistical method called group testing, we show in our recent <a href='https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/531d29a813ef9471aad0a5558d449a73-Abstract.html'>paper</a> that this is now feasible even in networks of up to 10 thousand neurons.
