title: "improv: real-time analysis and adaptive experimental designs"
excerpt: "<br><img src='/images/improv.png' width='80%'>
<br/><br/>A software platform for construction and orchestration of adaptive experiments, improv has been used to analyze streaming two-photon calcium images in larval zebrafish in real time and to fit GLM models to infer weighted connections among neurons as the experiment is ongoing. The codebase is open-source and freely available at [github.com/pearsonlab/improv](http://github.com/pearsonlab/improv), and the associated paper can be found [here](http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.22.432006v1).<br><br>
