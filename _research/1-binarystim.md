<br/><br/>How can we get connectivity between large systems of neurons in vivo? Using stimulations of small ensembles and a statistical method called group testing, we show in our recent <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13911'>paper</a> that this is now feasible even in networks of up to 10 thousand neurons: 10^8 connections!
