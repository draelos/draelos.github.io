**Mentors**: Here are a few of the organizations I volunteer with and highly recommend getting involved with. 

**Students**: Feel free to reach out to me directly, or look for mentors through these organizations. Also, get involved in outreach at any career stage! It has been hugely influential for me at all points in my academic training.


[Science Journal for Kids](https://sciencejournalforkids.org/): A great resource for teaching kids about all kinds of science. I interviewed with their 'meet a scientist' article series, you can check it out [here](https://sciencejournalforkids.org/articles/lesson-ideas/meet-a-scientist-anne-draelos/).


[Simply Neuroscience](https://www.simplyneuroscience.org/): A nonprofit that is student-run and focused on helping students further their careers in neuroscience and psychology. They have a great individual mentoring matching program.   


[Cientifico Latino](https://www.cientificolatino.com/): An organization focused on increasing diversity and equal access in STEM. They have a great mentorship program to help underrepresented students navigate the STEM graduate school application process.


[The Future Brighter](https://www.thefuturebrighter.org/): A nonprofit STEM outreach program for underserved elementary school students.  


[STARS Computing Corps](http://starscomputingcorps.org/): An NSF-funded organization dedicated to increasing diversity in the computing sciences. You can check to see if your university has a local chapter.
