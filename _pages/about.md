I am a postdoc in the Pearson Lab at Duke University studying machine learning and statistical techniques to facilitate real-time analysis of neural data. I am interested broadly in the design and construction of new measurement and analysis methods. 

**I am on the job market this year, looking for tenure-track positions in neuroscience, biomedical engineering, or physics.**

I studied both physics and computer science as an undergraduate at NC State University. Following my love of understanding complex networks, I then did an electrical & computer engineering masters and physics PhD at Duke University, focusing on low temperature quantum transport. After graduation, I shifted focus to a field with even more complicated systems to detangle: neuroscience. 

Outside of my research I enjoy reading, MMA, teaching my dogs new tricks, and dancing with my husband.
