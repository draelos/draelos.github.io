I am an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering and Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics at the University of Michigan. My lab applies machine learning and statistical techniques to facilitate real-time analysis of neural and behavioral data. We are interested broadly in the design and construction of new measurement and analysis methods in the streaming setting. We are affiliated with the Michigan Neuroscience Institute, the Michigan Institute for Data Science, and the Michigan Institute for Computational Discovery and Engineering. 

I studied both physics and computer science as an undergraduate at NC State University. Following my love of understanding complex networks, I then did an electrical & computer engineering masters and physics PhD at Duke University, focusing on low temperature quantum transport. After graduation, I shifted focus to a field with even more complicated systems to detangle: neuroscience, conducting a postdoc in Duke Neurobiology to develop a real-time neural analysis platform. 

Outside of my research I enjoy reading, MMA, teaching my dogs new tricks, and dancing with my husband.
